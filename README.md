### **Objective:** 
The objective of the project is the development of a web-based NFT Marketplace DApp, where transactions in the marketplace are made using
cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. 
Users will authenticate through an Ethereum wallet and will be able to buy and sell NFTs as well as mint new ones.
The marketplace must be based on a hybrid architecture with a MongoDB NoSQL database to store general information
while NFT transactions are managed by smart contracts."

### **Tools:** 
Spring boot, Solidity ,Micro Services , Angular , Ether.js , Hardhat, Devops : CI/CD,
Jenkens, Doker, Github, Mongodb, MetaMask
**Before starting, here is the process to follow during this project:**

### **A. Develop the necessary microservices**
### **B. Write a Smart Contract with Solidity**
### **C. Test the Contract**
### **D. Deploy the Contract to the blockchain using Hardhat**
### **E. Create Front end with Angular**
### **F. Connect MetaMask with Angular**
### **G. Connect Front end with Smart Contract using Ether.js**
